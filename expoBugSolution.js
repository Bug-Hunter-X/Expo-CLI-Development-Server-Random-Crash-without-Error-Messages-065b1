There's no definitive solution to this elusive Expo CLI crash issue as the root cause is uncertain.  However, consider these potential workarounds:

1. **Restart the development server:** The most immediate solution is to restart the Expo development server using `expo start`.  This is often sufficient to recover from a temporary crash.

2. **Check for conflicting packages:** Ensure you don't have conflicting packages in your `package.json`.  Review your dependencies for compatibility issues.

3. **Clean and rebuild:**  Try cleaning your project's cache and rebuilding it.  Delete your `node_modules` folder and reinstall your dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

4. **Upgrade Expo CLI:** Verify that you're using the latest version of Expo CLI. Run `expo upgrade` to see if a newer version addresses the crash.

5. **Simplify the project:** If possible, create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem.  A simple app with only essential features might help pinpoint the cause.

6. **Check the Expo forums:** Search the Expo forums and community for similar issues.  Others might have encountered the same problem and found a resolution.
